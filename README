nagios-wmi-plugin

The goal of this little nagios plugin is the following:

- Monitor the health of a Windows machine in a very simple way (little or no tuning should ever be necessary)
- Monitor all the basic OS factors that make a system healthy (free RAM, CPU load, free disk space, all services running)
- Do not make use of any locally installed agents (no sw beyond a normal Windows Server should be necessary)
- Use the native Windows subsystem available (amongst other things) for monitoring
